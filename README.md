Cryospheric Visualization and Analysis

Research Problem: Understanding of the cryosphere and the complex processes driving every aspect involved requires a great deal of background knowledge.

Abstract: Create an educational web page and/or tool to delve into each segment of the cryosphere, and present information such as:
- Where is the segment on the globe?
- What scientific instruments are used to measure them?
  - What satellites they are on and links to other instruments on that sat
- Shortcomings and future plans for each aspect


* Model after NIA2: pages show output viz and explain what's being looked at

* available Jupyter Notebooks used to parse data
* available Jupyter Notebooks used to create visualization


Frontend:
Options = HTML/CSS/JS or PyQt5 or Suave

Maybe I save the whole thing as a folder and require they download py notebook
